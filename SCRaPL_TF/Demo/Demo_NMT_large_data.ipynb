In large datasets (ie >= 100k SCRaPL parameters) is common to run out of memory or observe ineffective space exploration. NUTS parameters are tunned to achieve prespecified acceptance probability. In high dimensions this might translate to tiny step sizes, making the state exploration ineffective. To overcome that, we exploit the feature independence to reduce the dimensionality of the problem. More precisely, we infer posterior in batches (without replacement)."],"metadata":{"id":"ZS-a1lKGBWHJ"}},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"e6buIZRqkZT9"},"source":["from IPython import
